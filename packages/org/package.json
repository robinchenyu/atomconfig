After that, every file with an .org extension will be in \"org-mode\".\n\nYou probably don't want to use this yet, but you are very welcome to contribute.\n\nMy first goal is implement [structure editing](http://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-editing.html).\n\n## Functionality so far\n\nFiles with .org extension are in \"org-mode\", providing the following:\n* Insert empty headline with Cmd-Enter\n* Insert TODO headline with Shift-Cmd-Enter\n* Demote (shift right) headline with Alt-Right\n* Promote (shit left) headline with Alt-Left\n* Insert break on the fly when typing a '*'\n* TODO keyword is colored in red\n* Rudimentary state cycling TODO -> NEXT -> DONE with Shift-Right/Shift-Left \n## Roadmap\n\n* Structure editing\n* Custom TODO keywords\n* Basic Agenda views\n* Customization\n* Capturing\n* Advanced agenda views\n* Whatever else has been added to the original in 11 years of development :)\n",
